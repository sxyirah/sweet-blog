      <p style="font-family: 'Passion One', cursive; background-image: url(https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/20670343/thumb/1.jpg);"><b>Why did I choose computer science? This is a question that I get a lot from people around me, especially my family. In fact, I am not directly interested in this field and have no knowledge or basics about what is computer science. The first time I got an offer in this field, I kept wondering what exactly this computer science and what job can I apply when I graduate later. where will I go later? and can I carry this field?So, to answer all my questions, I decided to do research on computer science and try to find the blogs of former computer science students to know what experiences they went through while studying for a computer science diploma. after a few days do research and read some blogs of former computer science students. I am so afraid to accept the offer to continue studying in this field but for advice and support My family, I follow my heart and their advice to accept and try to learn first how to race a tak boleh go on jugak, stop and try to wait for a call from the other party.To be honest, my interest is more in the medic and theater. Those two fields are my priority to continue studying. But sustenance is not on my side. I set in my mind, there may be a reason why God provides for me in this field. with sustenance and qada qadar God determines. sometimes what we plan is not as good as what God has planned for us. okay we continue the story about my experience in computer science. when I start class, I become blur and feel people most stupid in class because mostly in class I already know a lot of basics about c ++ and from science stream class while I'm from literature class and don't know basic computer science at all. I don't even know what c ++ is. first sem I enjoy a lot of learning focus. just want to enter the world of university. more or less kind of culture shock until I failed two subjects for sem 1.pre -cal and csc126 (c ++ subject). I'm kind of not can accept failure, when I know I failed and my close friend passed the add on gp from a good person, I kept down and sad la.disspointed with myself because it's hard to accept failure and I feel like the most stupid hmmm..At that time, I was determined to stop studying, but thank God God gave me and surrounded me with supportive and good friends. They were the ones who gave me words of encouragement and advice to get up and continue the struggle in learning. Maybe there is also a reason why I failed this semester. guidance from God and pray a lot so that God gives me high strength to face the test test in seeking knowledge. after that, I still continue to study me in this field and praise be to God after I realize and sturggle study I pass every sem sampaila now last sem. even though as we all know that at the beginning of 2020 is the most challenging year for everyone in the world, especially us, the new students who want to experience the university world.In conclusion, to anyone who visits my blog and reads my short experience, if you are experiencing the same thing as me. I advise you to think correctly for your own future. Ask for advice, opinions and support from people around, especially the most close to us that is our own family. throughout my experience I studied 2 sem in college and 3 sem at home due to the pandemic, for me its hard but nothing easy in learning infact in our own life we ​​have to learn to be better and that not something that is easy for us to learn. this is not my passion but I make it a responsibility and sustenance from God that I need to run. if you are not interested at all, do not force yourself but if this is the only choice you have, consider it as sustenance and there may be a reason why you got this field. pray a lot, God willing everything will go smoothly. do not be afraid to try something that's new because this new one is teaching us something we didn't expect. wish you goodluck and all the best with whatever choice you make. as long as you can continue to learn, never stop learning because life always gives lessons to be used as experience.</p></b>
